# UI Enhancement Instructions (For AI Agents)

## Goal
Transform the current File Compressor Web App UI into a **polished, Apple-style interface** with:
- Clean, elegant layout
- Soft gradients, glassmorphism, subtle shadows
- Smooth animations & transitions
- Responsive, premium feel
- Minimalistic typography (San Francisco–like)
- Playful micro-interactions

## Design Style Reference
- Apple.com (UI layout, white space, typography)
- iOS/macOS settings panels
- Soft motion blur effects
- Frosted-glass backgrounds
- Rounded corners & soft shadows
- Gentle hover & click animations

## Enhancement Requirements
- Keep using **Bootstrap** (extend with custom CSS)
- No React/Vue frameworks unless explicitly asked
- Use **CSS animations + transitions** only
- Add drag-and-drop upload zone with hover effects
- Add animated progress indicators (CSS-based)
- Add smooth fade/slide transitions for UI elements
- Introduce light glassmorphism card for main panel
- Add modern buttons with hover ripple or lift effect
- Add subtle loading animation during compression
- Maintain full responsiveness for mobile + desktop

## Functionality (Do Not Change)
- Upload → Options → Compress → Download
- Flask backend flow remains same
- compressor.py logic stays intact
- No new dependencies unless minimal (e.g., GSAP optional)

## Optional Enhancements (Allowed)
- Animated header section
- Dark/light mode toggle with smooth transition
- Animated icons (Feather/Lucide)
- Soft gradient background with floating blobs
- Success animation when compression completes

## Not Allowed
- Heavy JS frameworks unless requested
- Rewriting backend logic
- Adding databases or cloud services

## Note for Agent
Focus on:
- Visual polish  
- Motion design  
- Better UX flow  
- Minimalistic Apple-like aesthetic
